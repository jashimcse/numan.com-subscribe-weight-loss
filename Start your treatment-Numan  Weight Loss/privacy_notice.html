          <b><h3 id="changes_notice">4. Changes to this privacy notice and your right to inform us of changes</h3></b>

          <p>This privacy notice was last updated on August 30, 2024. Historical versions can be provided by contacting us at <a class="links_ever" href="https://www.gmail.com">privacy@numan.com</a>.</p>

          <b><h3 id="lawful_bases">5. Our lawful bases for processing your data</h3></b>
          <p>When we process your data, we do it in a lawful manner. Under the UK GDPR, this means we use one or more of the following lawful bases:</p>

              <ul class="notice_explain">
                  <li>Your consent (<b>“Consent”</b>);</li>
                  <li>When you undertake a contract with us (<b>“Contract”</b>);</li>
                  <li>When it is necessary for us to comply with a law or regulation (<b>“Legal Obligation”</b>);</li>
                  <li>When we process information to provide a service or improve our business (<b>“Legitimate Interest”</b>);</li>
                  <li>In rare cases where we are asked to process information in the public interest (<b>“Public Interest”</b>); or</li>
                  <li>In extremely rare cases, we may need to process your information in order to protect life (<b>“Vital Interests”</b>).</li>
              </ul>

          <p>When we need to process special category data e.g., health information, biometric information, or data revealing racial or ethnic origin, we will only do so if we have a further lawful basis to do so, such as your explicit consent (<b>“Explicit Consent”</b>). </p> <br>

          <p>When we use Legitimate Interests as a lawful basis, this means we weigh privacy rights against the Legitimate Interests of the business for a particular activity. If we rely on our (or a third party's) Legitimate Interests, these interests will normally be to:
          </p>

          <ul class="notice_explain">
              <li>operate, provide and improve our business, including our website and app;</li>
              <li>communicate with you and respond to your questions;</li>
              <li>improve our website and app or use the insights to improve or develop marketing activities and promote our products and services; or</li>
              <li>detect or prevent illegal activities (for example, fraud); and/or to manage the security of our IT infrastructure, and the safety and security of our employees, customers, vendors and visitors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, it will be in a way which is reasonable for you to expect as part of the running of our business and which does not materially affect your rights and freedoms.</p>

          <b><h3 id="personal_data">6. Personal data we may collect about you</h3></b>

          <p>As a customer or patient of Numan and Numan.com, we may collect and use (<b>“process”</b>) certain information; your <b>“personal data”</b>, and what is called <b>“special category”</b> data. </p>

          <ul class="notice_explain">
              <li>Name, surname and username;</li>
              <li>Contact information such as your email address, telephone number and correspondence address; or</li>
              <li>Demographic information such as your age, date of birth or gender.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you enter into a contract with us we may use ‘Legal Obligation” as a lawful basis. When we use Legal Obligation, we mean that in order to provide healthcare services, we require certain personal data, for example to:.</p>

          <ul class="notice_explain">
              <li>Confirm your identity (to ensure we are providing healthcare to the right person);</li>
              <li>Assess your suitability for medication; </li>
              <li>Manage your health; or</li>
              <li>Manage side effects.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="notice_explain">
              <li>Technical information, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (of your computer or device), login data, browser type and version, cookies, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access our website and any communications we may send to you;</li>

          <p>Our business relies on collaboration with third parties (e.g., outside companies) to provide our services to you. Each third party provides an element of our services, for example, IT and cloud services, prescription, delivery, diagnostics or marketing services. </p>
          <p>For all third parties we use, we undertake data protection and information security due diligence prior to sharing any personal information. We also have in place contracts with specific data processing and sharing clauses to ensure that third parties process shared data strictly for the purposes we have instructed them to, or in lawful ways that we expect, such as privacy by design and default. </p>

          <p>When it is necessary for us to transfer personal information to third parties outside of the UK, this is only done in accordance with the UK GDPR (please see below for international transfers).</p>
          <p>Third parties we may share your personal information with include, for example:</p>

          <p>Most prescriptions are issued on a repeat basis.</p> <br>
          <p>The exact number of your repeat allowance is entirely dependent on our clinician's medical assessment of your online consultation.</p>

          <b>International transfers</b>
          <p>Almost all data we collect about you is stored and processed in the UK or EEA. However, from time to time, it may be necessary to transfer your data outside of these areas to deliver our services. </p>
          <p>Where your data is transferred outside the UK or the EEA, it will only be transferred where adequate safeguards can be applied, including:<br>

              <ul class="notice_explain">
                  <li>For transfers between the UK, EEA and countries with adequacy decisions in place, we safeguard transfers through implementing Standard Contractual Clauses (<b>“SCCs”</b>);</li>
                  <li>For transfers between the UK and US, we safeguard transfers through implementing the UK-US Privacy Framework, or SCCs;</li>

                  <li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law; and/or,</li>
                  <li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.</li>

              <b><h3 id="your_rights">11. Your rights in relation to your personal data</h3></b>

              <p>We strongly believe in the fair and transparent processing of your personal data and as such, we need to make you aware that you have rights under data protection law. These are called your ‘Individual Rights’, and include: </p>
              <p>You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. This right always applies. However, there are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process, for example, other peoples’ personal information, or information that is commercially sensitive</p>
              
              <b><p>Your right of access</p></b>
              <p>You have the right to ask us to rectify (i.e., correct) information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. This right always applies. </p>

              <b><p>Your right to rectification</p></b>
              <p>Sometimes we get it wrong and need to correct things, so please feel free to tell us. However, we would also love to hear from you if your circumstances change, such as when you move house, change your email or phone number, or when you change your name. </p>

              <b><p>Your right to be forgotten (erasure)</p></b>
          <p>You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. Whilst we will do our best to erase your personal data where we can, the right to be forgotten is not an absolute right - this is because we may need to keep certain elements of your information for legal obligations or other legitimate purposes. However, we will tell you if this is the case. </p>

          <b><p>Your right to restrict processing</p></b>
          <p>You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances.</p>

          <b><p>Your right to object to processing</p></b>
          <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information, in certain circumstances if you believe our processing impacts on your rights and freedoms and where we use either consent or legitimate interests. If we are processing on the basis of consent you can also withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
          <b><p>Your right to data portability</p></b>
          <p>You can request that we transfer your data to another service provider, or to you. Your right applies if you initially provided consent for us to use the data, or were under, or in talks about entering into a contract - and that the processing is automated. Note that your right only applies to information you have given us. </p>
          <b><p>Your right not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling</p></b>
          <p>At Numan, we use interactive AI bots to help you interact with our services and provide you with general lifestyle advice which is non-clinical. These are automated decision-making systems and can sometimes make mistakes (called hallucinations). Our clinicians monitor conversations to help mitigate this, however, you are always able to reach out to a human when interacting with our AI bots, if you are unsure of the information provided. </p>
          <p>You have a right not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling where:</p>

          <ul class="notice_explain">
              <li>automated individual decision-making has been used (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement); and</li>
              <li>profiling has been used (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual). Profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process.</li>
          </ul>

          <b><p>Exercising your rights</p></b>
          <p>Please contact us at <a class="links_ever" href="https://www.gmail.com">privacy@numan.com</a>, by post or over the phone if you wish to make a request. We will respond to your request without undue delay, and always endeavour to complete requests within one calendar month. </p>
          <p>Please note that not all rights are absolute. For example, where we are required to process your data as part of a legal obligation, we may be required to maintain this information.</p>

          <p>We won't charge for exercising your rights. However, we do reserve the right to charge an admin fee if your request is deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive.</p>
